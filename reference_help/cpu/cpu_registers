| **A**    | 8-bit  | Accumulator – arithmetic, logic, and data movement. Flags affected: N, Z, C, V.                                 |
| **X**    | 8-bit  | Index / loop counter – used for addressing modes. Affects N, Z flags.                                           |
| **Y**    | 8-bit  | Index / loop counter – similar to X. Affects N, Z flags.                                                        |
| **P**    | 8-bit  | Status flags: **N V - B D I Z C** (Negative, Overflow, ignored, Break, Decimal, Interrupt disable, Zero, Carry) |
| **PC**   | 16-bit | Program Counter – address of next instruction. Modified by branches/jumps/interrupts.                           |
| **S**    | 8-bit  | Stack Pointer – indexes `$0100-$01FF`. Used by push/pull/RTS/RTI.                                               |
